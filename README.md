### Try it out at:
* https://chonmycareer.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/365543c5-3506-4724-becc-08ec17067bf1/chat
* username: test01
* password: piwfew-nyvzod-7kIpmo
* #### Note that there's a bug on n8n hosted chat when using chat response node as shown in the image where the chat would only briefly show loading animation but it will eventually give a response correctly. This is a bug on n8n itself. If you are using my json template, disconnect the link to evaluation step and edit the "chat trigger node" to not use "respond to chat node"
